            "method": "preheat a non-stick skillet on medium-low heat. While the skillet preheats, crack the two eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk until eggs are completely mixed and slightly frothy. Add the freshly ground black pepper to the eggs. Pour the eggs into the pre-heated skillet and slowly mix with a spatula (mixing the eggs faster will lead to a thinner, creamier finished texture, while mixing slowly will produce larger firmer curds). When the eggs are nearly cooked through, take the pan off the heat and add salt to taste. Serve immediately.",
