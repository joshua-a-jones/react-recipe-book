Add the freshly ground black pepper to the eggs. Pour the eggs into the pre-heated skillet and slowly mix with a spatula (mixing the eggs faster will lead to a thinner, creamier finished texture, while mixing slowly will produce larger firmer curds). When the eggs are nearly cooked through, take the pan off the heat and add salt to taste. Serve immediately.",
